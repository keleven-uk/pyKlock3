Previous versions of pyKlock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of pyKlock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

<2017-2022>	pyKlock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - Finally settled on pySimpleGUI.
<2024-2025>	pyKlock 1 - CustomTkinter        - Not currently maintained [Most complete].
<2024>		pyKlock 2 - Flet.                - No font dialog.
<2025>		pyKlock 3 - QT.                  - problems with frame transparency, cannot be toggled programmable.
                                             - Can't set date to blank in QDateEdit.
<2025>		pyKlock 4 - wxPython.            - problems with frame transparency, effects all child widgets.


Note : pySimpleGUI is licensed software product, but free for hobbyist [but need to register]

Note : I use the correct spelling of colour on my side of the code.  :-)


V2026.44		[19 February 2026]

	Added a new menu item - Info.
		Added the first Info form, The display of a NTP server.  The time from the internet.
		Also shown is the local PC time and the difference between the two.
	Further tweaks to the update method.
	Further tweaks to the resize method.


V2026.43		[15 February 2026]

	Further tweaks to the update method.
	Further tweaks to the resize method.
	Corrected a problem with the digital time picking up the correct colour.

	Using python 3.14.3 and QT 6.10.2.


V2026.42		[12 February 2026]

	Refactored the updateTime method, so that some heavy stuff is only run every minute.
		Moved updateBattery, eventStory.update() and  sound playing to be checked every minute.
		This ensures that the sound playing is checked on the correct minute.
		Removed the flag checking in the sound module added in V2026.34.


V2026.41		[30 January 2026]

	Added the stuff which checks if an event is due - mostly copied from pyKlock1.
	It seems to work for events that are set for a future time but not for today.
		Changed the toast library to pyqttoast, looks better.
			https://github.com/ZyphrZero/pyqttoast
		But, doesn't allowed for user interaction - so the notification doesn't time out for the moment.
	Moved the initialise of the event store to the main program, so the main clock tick and call event update.


V2026.40		[30 January 2026]

	Implemented the edit buttons for both friends and events.
	Also, amended both tables so that the columns resize to their contents.


V2026.39		[28 January 2026]

	Implemented the delete events button.


V2026.38		[28 January 2026]

	Added the events add logic.


V2026.37		[27 January 2026]

	Completed the add events screen - still needs the add logic.
		This is called from the events viewer.
	Completed the events viewer close button.


V2026.36		[23 January 2026]

	Added an Events Viewer.
		The data is held in a CSV file and loaded into a custom events Store.
		The events store is a dictionary behind the scenes and is held in it's own class.
		Events is on it's menu, under the main menu of Things.
		Modelled heavily on the friends store.

	The toast came from https://github.com/niklashenning/pyqttoast
	Added a QToggle widget to display the binary choices in settings.
		QToggle came from https://github.com/luandiasrj/QToggle_-_Advanced_QCheckbox_for_PyQT6

	
V2026.35		[23 January 2026]

	Changed all the boolean properties in the settings window to toggle buttons from push buttons.
		Found at https://github.com/luandiasrj/QToggle_-_Advanced_QCheckbox_for_PyQT6 - Thank you.

	Added a new option to the Sound settings tab - to play the pips at a given volume to test loudness.

	Because the file progressBarStyles.py held styles for more then one widget - renamed to styles.py


V2026.34		[22 January 2026]

	The chimes were being missed.  The update loop was taking nearly two seconds, so the exact time was not found.
	The test for zero seconds was removed - so multiple chimes could occur.
	Each chimes is now controlled by a flag, so they will only chime once.
	The flags are reset after two minutes past, so the cycle can restart.

	The built in QT media player produced a fair bit of text output.
	This included a initial licence text on start up and what looked like debug information on play.
	Decided to go back to AudioPlayer, as used in earlier version of pyKlock.

	Moved across to VSCodium, which found some legacy spelling mistakes.

		Klock will, if configured, play the Cuckoo noise on the Hour, quarter past, half pas and a quarter to the hour.
		Klock will, if configured, play "the pips" on the hour.
		The settings have been added to config.toml - but not the configure pyKlock, yet.

		If no battery is installed [i.e. a PC], running on a/c is displayed.
		Added the required methods into systemInfo.py.

	Simplified the code for boot time in klock_utils.py.  The old one seemed to have stopped working.
