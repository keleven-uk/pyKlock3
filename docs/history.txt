Previous versions of pyKlock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of pyKlock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

	pyKlock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - finally settled on pySimpleGUI.
	pyKlock 1 - CustomTkinter.
	pyKlock 2 - Flet.
	pyKlock 3 - QT.  [this]

	Note : pySimpleGUI is licensed software product, but free for hobbyist [but need to register]

Note : I use the correct spelling of colour on my side of the code.  :-)

If no branch indicated, assume main branch.


V2025.3		[27 October 2025]

	Added properties for x_pos, y_pos, width & height of the main form.
		These are saved in the config file and restored when Klock is re-run.

	Klock now asks "Are you sure you want to close the application?" on closure.


V2025.2		[26 October 2025]

	Added menu's.
		File - close.
		Display - Foreground Colour.
		Display - Background Colour.

	For both the display options, a colour picker is launched and the new colour can be selected.
	The colours of the main form and the statusbar are then updated.
	The new colours are then saved in the config file.
	These config values are used to set the Klock colours on start up.


V2025.1		[24 October 2025]

	Basic implementation of pyKlock.
	The app is created in python [3.13.7] using the QT GUI framework.
	The app displays the current time in the format HH:MM:SS.
	The app consists of the following -
		Current time
		Statusbar [Date - Status - Idle Time].
            Status - shows the status of Caps Lock, Insert, Scroll Lock & Num Lock.
