Previous versions of pyKlock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of pyKlock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

	pyKlock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - finally settled on pySimpleGUI.
	pyKlock 1 - CustomTkinter.
	pyKlock 2 - Flet.
	pyKlock 3 - QT.  [this]

	Note : pySimpleGUI is licensed software product, but free for hobbyist [but need to register]

Note : I use the correct spelling of colour on my side of the code.  :-)
