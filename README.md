pyKlock - a clock with a k.

A multifunction timing thingy, where some [but not necessary all] of the things are useful.

pyKlock serves as a vehicle by which I learn and tinker with programming.

Previous versions of pyKlock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of pyKlock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

    pyKlock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - finally settled on pySimpleGUI.  Most complete.
    pyKlock 1 - CustomTkinter.
    pyKlock 2 - Flet.
    pyKlock 3 - QT - this one.

    
A klock built using Python and QT6 GUI Framework.

Using python 3.14.0 and QT 6.10.0.

Note : I use the correct spelling of colour on my side of the code.  :-)

pyKlock displays the time [local], date, key status and the computers idle time.
Key status is the status of Caps Lock, Insert, Scroll lock and Num lock.

The time can be displays as either a LED Klock or as The Famous Fuzzy Time.
The Famous Fuzzy Time displays the time in words rounded to the nearest five minutes.
The te4xt time can also be displayed in a number of other formats [Binary, Roman Time, Hex Time etc.]

The foreground and background colours can be selected.
